				<h2>Feeling SORE?</h2>
				<p>
We Can Help.  Since 2007, millions of cases of PTSD have been induced upon innocent, unsuspecting intranet surfers. Maybe it was a link a friend sent about Jessica Simpsons steamy love affair, or a picture
of a kitten from your aunt, or maybe even an emailed memo from your boss.  Everyone remembers their first rick roll, that
consciousness shattering, life defining moment when a boyish ginger soul crooner scorched his infernal melody upon your
poor, unprepared psyche.</p>


<p>Some people may say that it was just a joke, a mildly annoying, maybe even catchy song... But We Understand You.  For
a small percentage of the population (our research indicates 5-10%), this traumatic moment triggered something deep
and painful, a sight that could not be unseen.  For those of you with the Image of Astley burned into your retina, We
Are Here For You. </p>
